          <h2>Report by Jeremy Dennis</h2>
          <h2>Caption 2000</h2>
          
          <p>2000's been a funny year, hasn't it? I keep feeling as if I'm spinning on, even though the world's
          ended. I can't quite get used to a future being here after all. And of course, I wasn't running Caption
          any more, for the first time since 1992, when we started it all out of my college room and two bright
          ideas. We'd passed it on to the new ones.</p>
          
          <p><img src="why.jpg" hspace="8" align="left" width="300" height="199" border="0" alt="" /><i> Report by <a href="../c99/matt/jeremy-dennis.html">Jeremy Dennis</a>. Images by various talented individuals at the My Fabulous Life
          minicomic workshop at Caption 2000.</i></p>
          
          <p>Caption is the small press, independent and alternative comics convention we've been running in
          Oxford for some year, and if you've not been, you really should give it a shot, because it is a lot of fun,
          as I found out finally this year. True, I've been to eight, but this was the first one I've ever seen when I
          wasn't on committee, and it's a lot more fun that way. I'd feel sorry for the new committee, but they've
          already been to a few, which was just as well, considering that all we'd been able to give them to run the
          convention with was a badly decayed mailing list, reams of conflicting advice, and the sure knowledge
          that we really still weren't sure what makes Caption work.</p>
          
          <p>Maybe it's the sunshine -- though people always do complain that it's too bright and too hot.
          Maybe it's the beer, though there's not much choice even if it is very cheap. Perhaps it's the site,
          though the marble staircase and  morris wallpaper and pictures of politicians when they were young and
          scary surely can't entirely make up for the stuffyness and the stairs. And then there are the panels
          (never my favourite bit) and the workshops (where we actually draw and make stuff) and the exhibition
          (my baby!) and the stalls and so on, but lots of events have those. I don't know what it is, but people
          have said to me, over the years, again and again, Caption's different.</p>
          
          <p><img src="duck.jpg" hspace="8" align="right" width="188" height="284" border="0" alt="" />And, having finally been to one, I actually think they're right.</p>
          
          <h4>Friday</h4>
          <p>Technically speaking, the event doesn't actually start till Saturday, but I'd been going all Thursday
          on preparations for the exhibition, and by Friday lunch time I was photocopying my new minicomic. Any
          small press person'll tell you that's not bad going. This year I was providing my services to Caption as
          local cartoonist -- co-ordinating the exhibition and running a Saturday workshop. The exhibition was
          giving me headaches. I wanted to hang the pieces from invisible thread and bent pins, but the only pins
          I had at home snapped when I took the pliers to them. I'd tried four of them before it occurred to me
          that I might put someone's eye out, mine, for example. Luckily my friend Lynn, who has red hair and
          sews, found me in the back of the jeans shop where we were laughing at t-shirts and explained to me
          that there were different sorts of pins, and that I just had to buy the right ones.</p>
          
          <p>She then walked me round the corner and through a door I'd never noticed before and up a flight of
          stairs there was a stealth haberdashers. Fantastic! Pins bought -- now all I needed was a magnifying
          glass, for the condom packet.</p>
          
          <p><img src="kitties.jpg" hspace="8" align="left" width="200" height="311" border="0" alt="" />I scooted home and dragged out the pritt and the glue gun for last minuite additions and repairs to
          the exhibition pieces, only to find <a href="../c99/matt/damian-cugley.html">Damian</a> (<a href="../../pdc/">my housemate</a>, who draws stick figures and gets migraines)
          collapsed in bed with a flannel over his face whimpering for lucozade and a bowl to be sick in. There's
          no arguing with him when he's in that state, so I changed his flannel and fetched him the bowl and the
          sugar water... and <i>then</i> abandoned him to go and help with the set-up.</p>
          
          <p>We'd had some sort of crazy idea about setting up the exhibition the night before, but the place
          (like much of Oxford in the summer) was crowded with EFL students who were having some sort of
          disco that night, and I didn't want to leave anything interesting in the line of sight of drunk Spanish
          teenagers. "What can I do?" asked <a href="../c99/matt/alex-williams.html">Alex</a>, new on the committee this year, a slacker-sado-masochist
          with floppy hair.  I passed him the pliers and the pins. "You can bend these," I said.</p>
          
          <p>The exhibition was called <i>Tiny objects of fear</i>. I unpacked it, nervously, onto the tables --
          it had been bashed a bit on the bus, but most of the pieces were still more or less holding together. I
          plugged in the glue gun and mended what needed it. At the bottom of the bag, after all the pieces had
          been checked and accounted for, I find a tiny green glass bead. I can't even begin to guess where it's
          come from. <a href="../c99/matt/ian-snell.html">Ian</a>, uncompromising committee member and grim treasurer, laughs at me. "That's your
          tiny object of fear!" he says.</p>
          
          <p><img src="booze.jpg" hspace="8" align="right" width="200" height="292" border="0" alt="" />Like I said, technically nothing starts till the Saturday, but the helpers and the people who want to
          make a weekend of it tend to fetch up down The Turf, a local pub with very low ceilings. We sit there all
          night and drink summer beer with stupid names and talk about comics, and the kids worry about
          whether anyone will turn up tomorrow while I sit there trying not to get too much beer on new comic #1,
          <i>The Plot Thickens</i> by skinny anarchist from <a href="../c99/matt/gavin-burrows.html">Brighton Gavin</a> and his harem of artists.</p>
          
          <p>We try not to stay too late, so I get to watch <i>Buffy</i> while I'm collating the new minicomic,
          but between the whiskey and the Sci Fi channel it's two in the morning before I'm done collating. I'm
          terrible at collating.</p>
          
          <p>But thankfully Gavin fits into the hole in the comic boxes I prepared for him earlier.</p>
          
          <h4>Saturday</h4>
          <p><img src="lovemars.jpg" hspace="8" align="left" width="300" height="211" border="0" alt="" />We're late, inevitably. We're late and there are roadworks so we have to walk to the next busstop
          but the first thing we see when we get there is <a href="../c99/matt/gideon-nisbet.html">Gideon</a>, a fuzzy biker classicist who always used to help
          us out, putting up the signs. Not my job any more! Raaaay! Of course, I do have to put up the
          exhibition, but that's different. More pins, for starters. And the pins hurt, when I press them in, and the
          invisible string keeps disappearing when I try to knot it, and on the whole, if it hadn't looked so much
          better than I'd imagined it would, it would have been an impossible bother. As it is, though, I can't stop
          grinning. And while I've been working, <a href="../c98/howard-stangroom.html">Howard</a>, king of 30th Century Comics and purveyor of filth,
          furries, and ancient Jimmy Olson comics, has turned up and this year he's brought dozens of scary
          Christian comics. Before the weekend is out, we'll all have shuddered out way through <i>Little Hansa
          who loved the Swastika</i>.</p>
          
          <p>Downstairs, <a href="../c99/matt/jenni-scott.html">Jenni</a>, <a href="http://www.jenniscott.net/">the beautiful blonde founder of Caption</a>, is holding court in the bar, and <a href="../../pdc/c97/pete-ashton.html">Pete</a>,
          comics-into-bookshops activist and the man behind <a href="http://www.bugpowder.com/">Bugpowder</a>, has covered his stall with
          frighteningly desirable books and comics and cds, many of them by James Kochalka. But the garden's
          demanding my attention. It's full of lovely comics, sun, and beer, and anyway, I want to try out my new
          action man camera. I buy a pint and zimber out. The sky's blue.</p>
          
          <p>Outside we compare cameras and talk. The camera thing's funny. Maybe we all really want to do
          photo love stories. We have more beer, and (another) <a href="../c99/matt/jenni-cole.html">Jenni, a stylish fan-friend from London</a>, gives me
          some cake. The afternoon slides by. Presumably there's a programme going on inside the building
          somewhere. Lateish I get restless and wander in to see what's going on. There are people I don't know
          drawing pretty pictures in the bar, (another) Pete, <a href="http://www.slaboconcrete.com/">Slab-O-Concrete</a> publisher from Brighton, has a
          table of neat stuff set up, and the workshop is full of people making voodoo dolls out of pipe cleaners
          and goggly eyeballs. And tarot cards. Lots of tarot cards. Luckily there's a psychologist in the room
          keeping an eye on them; <a href="../c99/gideon/ruth-oreilly.html">Ruth</a>, the committee member with the amazing red curly hair.</p>
          
          <p><img src="scooter.jpg" hspace="8" align="right" width="300" height="216" border="0" alt="" />It's auction time before I know it. I've got some stuff in it, but I've had a few years practising
          coping with seeing my stuff auctioned. Not so some of the people here. One of the Monostark boys
          (strange yet lovely cartoonists from Bristol) is videoing the cringes. It must be art. As usual, the food
          turns up before we're finished.</p>
          
          <p>We eat revolting pizza and slug back nice wine in the garden. The pizza's pretty icky, but I don't
          particularly mind. I never like breaking conventions for meals, I hate the palaver of finding a
          restaurant, I'm more interested in the wine, and anyway I'm being subjected to embarassing quantities
          of praise from Andrew, who looks eerily like one of my prettier cartoons come to life. The squirrels fight
          for our entertainment in the gathering dusk, and Jenni, perhaps inspired by their viciousness, starts
          thumb wrestling a variety of variably manly opponents. Before things get out of hand, there's a
          scramble to finish the auction. I only buy one thing -- a video of Chris de Burgh live. </p>
          
          <p>The auction raised heaps of money for the Cartoon Art Trust, about £500, I think. It'll go to
          courses and workshops, that sort of thing. Then we head back to the bar, leaving Jenni still
          thumb-wrestling men into submission, and the garden lightly festooned with smouldering video
          tape.</p>
          
          <p><img src="friends.jpg" hspace="8" align="left" width="200" height="301" border="0" alt="" />Last stop of the evening is The National Theatre of Earth Prime, whose poorly-rehearsed and often
          incomprehensible antics are always saved until everyone has been in close proximity to a very cheap
          bar for the maxmum possible hours. Usually <a href="../c99/matt/mark-boyes.html">Mark</a> (tall and lugubrious), Penny (sleek and Nikitaesque)
          and Jason (a patent lawyer), at least manage to pick a comic to desecrate, but this year even that
          seemed beyond their grasp, and instead we had to settle for <i>The Matrix</i>, complete with amazing
          special effects, a full compliment of leather trousers, and caption cards, to help poor Keanu get those
          more difficult emotions across to the audience.</p>
          
          <p>And sometime later I think we went home, though my last really coherent memory is of Andrew
          backing me into the corner demanding that I drew him filth, filth and more filth!</p>
          
          <h4>Sunday</h4>
          
          <p>Sunday starts very grim. I have a black hangover and staying in bed is almost as horrible as
          getting up. I ooze towards a cheese-and-pickle sandwich breakfast, trying to remember what I need to
          bring today. Mmmmer, comics, tippex, magic markers, prozac. I think I've remembered everything.
          We're due on a panel at noon. Alex is going to regress us so that we remember what happened at last
          century's Captions. I'd rather forget about Caption altogether and crawl into bed for an all-day
          hangover. I pour more water over my head and open the front door. And shut it again. Sunglasses.</p>
          
          <p><img src="moo.jpg" hspace="8" align="right" width="300" height="183" border="0" alt="" />Try again.</p>
          
          <p>Sometime after noon we wobbled off the bus, the phone vibrating as we strode down Cornmarket
          Street, dodging henna tattooists and hair-braiders and early string quartets. It's Alex, "Where are
          you?" he asks. "Door," I say. It looks like I'm down to one syllable sentences, and that's not going to
          be much fun for the people watching me getting regressed. Alex is still going, "Huh? But eventually he
          lets me know that the door is open, the gate is open, and I get in, only to find that the bar is
          closed.</p>
          
          <p>Sat there, twisting my fingers, waiting for coffee I don't really want, and no-one'll miss this stupid
          thing if it doesn't happen, and reaching for a pen to maybe draw something and then putting it down.
          More and more people building up at the bar and reminding myself and reminding myself that it's not
          my fault any more. Remembered that I was running a workshop that afternoon, groaning inwardly and
          wondering why I'd ever said yes to that one, oh god.</p>
          
          <p><img src="skate.jpg" hspace="8" align="left" width="200" height="311" border="0" alt="" />And oh fuck I forgot the stapler. And the guillotine, oh and everything probably. And I really don't
          want to be regressed.</p>
          
          <p> On the bus, going home again. Dark in my house, all peaceful on my own, and then <a href="../c99/matt/terry-wiley.html">Terry</a> called
          from A&E. Terry's one of the gratuitous bunnies who make <i>Sleaze Castle</i>, and he's there with
          <a href="../c99/matt/dave-mckinnon.html">Dave</a>, the other bunny, the sullen one, and Dave's destroyed arm. Amidst the excitement of the mass
          thumb-wrestling and squirrel-taunting in the garden the night before, Dave had initiated Pete
          Bugpowder into the Church of Bob and in a moment of enthusiasm, Pete had flung himself (in a strictly
          platonic way) into Dave's arms, tumbling him heavily down onto the rock-hard ground. The arm landed
          first and we fed him codeine and bad advice until he went back to his hotel room in disgust. The arm, it
          seemed, was as bad this morning as it had been the previous night. "The waiting list is down to four
          hours," he says, "So we might make it back in time to say goodbye to everyone."</p>
          
          <p>Chastened and put back into perspective I went back to the convention with a rucksack full of
          stapler and guillotine, where the bar is open and Alex buys me a great deal of gin. I'm improving fast. I
          might even try a panel.</p>
          
          <p><img src="wine.jpg" hspace="8" align="right" width="200" height="293" border="0" alt="" />These questions make no sense. Why is this person going on about that? Yes, we know. Yes, we

          <p>Why do I go to panels? My workshop's right now and I've seldom felt less able to tell a roomfull of
          adults what to do. I try to remember when I last ran a workshop. It's like trying to remember when I
          last had sex, I know it happened but it's never there being reassuring when you need it ,in fact, the only
          times I can think of are the ones where everything went wrong and everyone was bored and I fetched
          up feeling like a complete fool. The workshop's called <b>My Fucked-up Life</b>. Cue hollow laughter.
          </p>
          
          <p>My Fucked-up Life. Who thought of that? The pen twists in my hand. Perfect line, colours that
          shine. "Shall I announce the workshop?" asks Ruth. Looking at art, back to the start. "Do you want a
          drink", says Damian. Pint of gin, dreaming of sin. I've not idea what I was planning to do. Tiny comic,
          gin and tonic. "Jeremy?"</p>
          
          <p><img src="bed.jpg" hspace="8" align="left" width="200" height="296" border="0" alt="" />"Yeah," I say, "announce it. No, I'll announce it. No, you announce it. But it's not My Fucked-up
          Life anymore, okay? It's My Fabulous Life."</p>
          
          <p>Later. The bar. The workshop went okay. Here for the duration, the convention disassembling
          around me, nice just to sit here and talk. Gentle rain falling just in time to catch the stallholders going
          home, but they did okay, no-one's too sad, except Pete who tells me, "Maybe it's had it's day."
          Caption, the convention that won't lie down and die, lurches awkwardly to a close around us,
          uncomfortable goodbyes and anxious determinations, must make a comic, must organise an event,
          must get in touch, must sort out my website...</p>
          
          <p>The new committee plus mates and hangers wander off for curry to say thankyou and goodbye first.
          The numbers lurch up and down and the restaurant hates us, not surprising considering that we're all
          sweating beer by this stage and almost too tired to sit down. We stow the flip charts in the corner and
          try to remember what we ordered. I can't believe I didn't just go home. Then one Jenni has to go home
          but the other Jenni has a much better idea. "You should come back to hotel for a drink," she says,
          "They've got carp."</p>
          
          <p>Later and later, sat there in the soft green Galaxie, drinking champagne and eating chips and
          kebabs and talking about superheros and sleep and nothing and listening to the rain falling into the
          deep pool in the dark garden where the carp float like the lost reflections of dying red suns.</p>
