          <p>This page discusses how I took the pictures.</p>
          <p>
            I borrowed <a href="http://www.rcai.demon.co.uk/qv10.htm">Rafe's Casio QV-10 digital camera</a>
            to take to CAPTION97.  This allowed me to take lots more pictures
            compared last year with my own camera, a fully-manual SLR.
            For one thing,
            it has no knobs to fiddle with (being fixed-focus and
            adjusting to light levels automatically).
            It is also quick and quiet, and can hold 96 pictures before I
            have to transfer them to a computer.  Of course the images are
            much lower resolution than a film camera -- but this  is
            just right for a web page.
            In the end I came away with 185 snaps, which has been narrowed
            down a little for this selection.
          </p>
          <p>
            After transferring them to my 486 (as it then was) as JPEG files,
            I needed a way to index them.  I threw together a display program
            in Tcl (the Tool Command Language, pronounced &quot;tickle&quot;).
            As well as listing the pictures by file name, it also allowed
            me to enter the names of people and descriptions, and a score
            (one of Good, Keep, Discard).  The data files produced using this
            viewer were  used by the Tcl scripts I used  to generate
            the index pages and the per-person pages automatically
            (<a href="http://www.alleged.demon.co.uk/pdc/wp/usingTcl.html">as described elsewhere</a>).
