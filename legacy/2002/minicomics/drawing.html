    <h1>Drawing tips</h1>
    <h2>Artwork</h2>
    <p>
      The image presented to a photocopier should be dense black ink on
      white paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grey washes will generally result in blotchy
      effects&mdash;photocopiers do not have an equivalent of the
      half-toning process used in professional printing.  You can of course
      supply your own half-tones, but these must be fairly
      coarse&mdash;coarser than the patterns used in professional printing.
      (That said, modern copiers are better than old ones used to
      be&mdash;you may want to experiment.)
    </p>
    <p>
      You often see professionals using special process-blue pencils
      that do not need to be erased because the processes used in magazine
      printing are blind to this colour blue.  Photocopiers <em>do</em> see
      process blue, so these pencils will probably not be useful for
      minicomics.
    </p>
    <h2>Registration</h2>
    <p>
      Photocopying is never completely accurate.  It follows that you
      cannot have artwork that extends to the edge of the page, because it
      will end up not quite meeting or overlapping the border.  Printed
      magazines trim paper from the outside edges of the page, which allows
      for <em>bleeds</em> (where the printed artwork well extends beyond the
      trim line).
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead you should allow for fairly generous margins between the
      artwork and the page.  Straight, ruled borders can also be a
      liability&mdash;they make it easier to see that the copying is
      slightly out of register.  Ragged, hand-drawn borders are safer.
