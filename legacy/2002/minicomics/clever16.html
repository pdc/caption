    <h1>Making a 16-page minicomic</h1>
    <p>
      This recipe makes a minicomic in A7 format
      (74&nbsp;mm&times;105&nbsp;mm before trimming) with sixteen pages
      (including the front and back covers).
    </p>

    <p>
      Because it does the folding and stapling <em>before</em> trimming, you
      get a neater edge.  The downside is that preparing the artwork is a
      little fiddlier.  You may prefer <a href="simple16.html">a simpler method</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>Draw</h2>
    <p>
      Break down your story in to 16 pages.  Remember that page 1 is the
      front cover, and you will probably want to reserve page 16 the back
      cover.  That leaves 14 pages for story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start with two A4 pieces of paper.  These correspond to the two
      sides of the printed page.  Fold each once lengthways and twice
      widthways to divide them in to eight panels (or mark out the divisions
      in pencil).  Draw the pages of your story in the
      following order:
    </p>
    <table class="display" summary="Diagrams of side A and side B">
      <tr>
        <th>Side A</th>
        <th>Side B</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="clever16-front.png" width="299" height="212" /></td>
        <td><img src="clever16-back.png" width="299" height="212" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      The grey reversed figures show the corresponding page on the other
      side.  Where the numbers are upside down, the picture has to be upside
      down too (turn the paper over).  In all cases the top of the panel
      points to the middle of the paper.

    <h2>Printing</h2>
    <p>
      One double-sided A4 copy makes one minicomic.  Nowadays copy shops
      have machines that can be shown both sides of the page and then print
      double-sided copies automatically and so we let them handle
      everything.  In the olden days we did this by making copies of one
      side, then using the copies to fill the paper drawer in order to print
      the other side (or using the manual-feed tray, depending on the
      machine).  Generally we had to make a few trial copies to get the
      second side the right way up...
    </p>
    <h2>Folding and stapling</h2>
    <p>Now fold each piece of paper three times in this order:</p>
    <blockquote><img src="clever16-fold.png" width="534" height="269" /></blockquote>
    <p>
      To help remember the order, notice that the first fold brings
      pages 2 and 3 together, and the second brings 12 and 13 together.
    </p>
    <p>After making the third fold, staple the packet through the spine.</p>
    <h2>Trimming</h2>
    <p>
      Now all that is left is some work with a guillotine or scalpel to
      slice off a millimetre or two from the outside edges of the packet
      (not the spine!), thus separating the pages and making a finished
      minicomic.
