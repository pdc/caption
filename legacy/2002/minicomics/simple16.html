    <h1>Making a 16-page minicomic</h1>
    <p>
      This recipe makes a minicomic in A7 format
      (74&nbsp;mm&times;105&nbsp;mm before trimming) with sixteen pages
      (including the front and back covers).
    </p>

    <p>
      If you like you can trim it a little more to make credit-card sized
      (<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html#id">officially</a>
      85&#183;60&nbsp;mm &#215; 53&#183;98&nbsp;mm).
    </p>
    <h2>Draw</h2>
    <p>
      Break down your story in to 16 pages.  Remember that page 1 is the
      front cover, and you will probably want to reserve page 16 the back
      cover.  That leaves 14 pages for story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start with two A4 pieces of paper.  These correspond to the two
      sides of the printed page.  Fold each once lengthways and twice
      widthways to divide them in to eight panels (or mark out the divisions
      in pencil).  Draw the pages of your story in the
      following order:
    </p>
    <table class="display" summary="Diagrams of side A and side B">
      <tr>
        <th>Side A</th>
        <th>Side B</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><img src="simple16-front.png" width="299" height="212" /></td>
        <td><img src="simple16-back.png" width="299" height="212" /></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The grey reversed figures show the corresponding page on the other side.</p>

    <h2>Printing</h2>
    <p>
      One double-sided A4 copy makes one minicomic.  Nowadays copy shops
      have machines that can be shown both sides of the page and then print
      double-sided copies automatically and so we let them handle
      everything.  In the olden days we did this by making copies of one
      side, then using the copies to fill the paper drawer in order to print
      the other side (or using the manual-feed tray, depending on the
      machine).  Generally we had to make a few trial copies to get the
      second side the right way up...
    </p>
    <h2>Cutting</h2>
    <p>The printed pages need to be sliced in to quarters:</p>
    <blockquote><img src="simple16-cut.png" width="315" height="225" /></blockquote>
    <p>
      One very useful piece of equipment for the small presser: a small
      office guillotine.  We have one that tucks underneath the bookshelf.
      The alternative is a cutting mat, craft knife, and a metal ruler, but
      it is harder to make tidy edges this way.
    </p>
    <h2>Collating</h2>
    <p>
      You now have four piles of bits of paper, each containing four
      pages of the final comic.  All that remains is gathering one from each
      pile and stapling them together in the right order.
    </p>
    <blockquote><img src="simple16-collate.png" width="285" height="210" /></blockquote>
    <p>
      A single staple in the spine should suffice.  With comics this
      small, a standard desktop stapler should be big enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the cutting up of the pages happens before the stapling,
      you will inevitably end up with a slightly uneven edge to the pages.
      You can fix this by guillotining the outside edges of the stapled mini
      to make them neater.  There is <a href="clever16.html">a clever method</a> which
      avoids having to do two lots of cutting by folding before stapling
      instead of cutting.
