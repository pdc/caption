        Okay, Kid, listen up. <a href="../">CAPTION</a> is the UK's longest-running small
        press and alternative comics convention. Every year it fills up the
        Oxford Union buildings on St Michael's Street Oxford OX1 with an even
        worse sort of punks and reprobates than usually frequents such a
        dive. The beer's cheap, and the people are cheaper. They sell comics
        there, too. Lots of Comics. Weird comics, blue comics, obscure strange
        old new comics. If you take them yours, they'll sell them, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's Panels, talks, workshops, shows, some sort of charity
        auction (all donations gratefully received) and a big bar.
        But none of
        that matters for now. What we're talking is the exhibition, a big
        corridor Full of dangerous comics, and we want one of them to have
        your name on it. Something twisted, disturbing, dark and decidedly
        noir. your own little black book. You know how to make one, don't you?
        <a href="minicomics/">You just put pen to paper and scribble</a>.
      </p>
      <p id="explanation">
        This year, CAPTION celebrates Noir.
        As Noir is a classic genre, so we
        celebrate a classic format: <strong>the minicomic</strong>.
        <em>Mini</em>, as in A6 (105&times;144&nbsp;mm)
        or smaller, <em>comic</em>, as in 2 or more panels/pages.
        
        So you want to know if you can break the rules.  Well, that's only to
        be expected. you can break the rules, you can always break the rules.
        But please. Try to have a good reason.  You don't want to draw. You
        can't draw. Well, I disagree, but I won't argue. You don't have to
        draw.  Put together a small book of evidence, writing, or collage
        instead. I always find the soap opera pages in TVQuick especially
        inspirational. It's up to you. Sequential art is a broad church. I'll
        leave it to you to define the boundaries. Just remember -- you're
        making a <em>noir</em> minicomic. So let's have no hearts and flowers. That's
        so ... last year.
        
        Minicomic variations: classic 16pp, 4p folded, crossover folded,
        zig-zag folded, square stitched, or just draw two panels on the back
        of your form!
