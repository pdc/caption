        <a href="workshop/page1.htm"><strong>Jeremy Dennis</strong> reports on the
        Crazy Caption Comics Cluedunnit</a>:
        '<em>The sun slanted into the room like cold iron bars, ready to knock me out
        or beat me up, I&nbsp;wasn't quite sure which yet. It was a pitiless
        afternoon, defiantly bright and cheerful. And here was I, with murder in
        my heart and last night's hangover scratching at the back of my
        eyeballs, with
        a bag full of black pens and a room full of punks eager
        to put them to bad use.</em>'

        <a href="http://www.bahala-na.co.uk/articles/caption2k2.htm"><strong>David Goodman</strong></a>:
        '<em>This year, Caption's theme was Noir, exploring the darker
        side of society, the seedy and the sleazy, the violent and desperate...
        ...But the weather was fabulously sunny, which rather spoilt that
        whole atmosphere. Then again, nobody seemed to mind much!</em>'

        <a href="http://www.ninthart.com/display.php?article=366"><strong>Antony Johnston</strong></a>:
        '<em>Caption is very, very English, and this be comes apparent the moment you enter the site. It's held in the Oxford Union Society building, for a start (Home to a political debating society). There's a small picnic area outside, all very green and
        pleasant. The building itself is rather small, especially by "normal" convention standards, with just two rooms and a bar.
        The bar, of course, is another thing that perpetually reminds you that you aren't at a US convention.</em>'
