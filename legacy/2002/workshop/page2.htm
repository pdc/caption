<img src="workshop3.jpg" align="left" vspace=15 hspace=5>For those as
don't know what Caption's all about, it's kind of a meeting, for people
who share certain interests. There's always a lot of business to be done
there, old contacts to hook up with, new folk to meet, progress and
plans to check up on, you know how it goes.
</p>

<p>

The thing is, the sort of people who come to this sort of event have
certain expectations. There's the regular stuff they're expecting, like
cheap beer, a wide variety of quality merchandise, and some thorough and
meaningful discussion. And then, there's the action they're after that
isn't quite so straightforward, and that's where people like me come in.

<img src="workshop4.jpg" align="right" vspace=10 hspace=10><br>What I do
is different every year, though if you lean in close you'll spot common
threads. Clothes pegs, comic bags, beer glasses. Opportunities for
involvement, working at speed, no spectators. I guess I'm halfway
between a providor and a provoker. I'm supplying a need, certainly, but
everything I give to people at Caption is stuff they brought here
themselves.

<p>It's one sweet con, and the sweetest thing about it is that afterwards,
they'll thank you.</p>
