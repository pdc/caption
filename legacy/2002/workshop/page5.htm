they should end up not needing you. And if I occasionally use that
excuse to down a few too many in the bar while I'm giving the teams
their space, well it's only natural. I have a hangover and therefore must
drink. They have magic markers, and therefore must draw. </p> 

<p>By the time I got upstairs again, the cops had boiled their story
down to a single, terrifyingly concentrated page, the detectives had
welded their group into a production-line comics team (pose, sketch,
pencil, ink, finish) and the private dicks had disappeared entirely. I
found them outside, stood under a lamp-post, three pages drawn and three
more planned, their differences resolved by changing artists before each
new scene. </p>

<p><img src="workshop10.jpg" align="right" vspace=10 hspace=10><br>There
were still problems to be solved, of course. A couple of story elements
that just wouldn't stick. A wig that didn't exactly say "Dame". A small
matter of two of the pieces being kidnapped so some crazy dame could
hold up a comics stall. But that's why I'm there, to sort out all those
little problems. To clear the way, so people can get on
without getting hung up on egos and anxieties and panic about this not
being good enough or that not being just right and all the usual crap
that holds a good story down.</p>
