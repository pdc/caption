<p>East Oxford Community Centre, 44b Princes Street, Oxford OX4 1DD
</p>
<p>Too Olde Worlde to have a web site of its own, the East Oxford
   Community Centre finds itself in the middle of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowley_Road%2C_Oxford">Cowley Road</a>,
   main shopping street of East Oxford (see it on <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=ox4+1hu&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=15&amp;ll=51.748448,-1.237206&amp;spn=0.012195,0.039654&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=addr">Google maps</a>).
   It has a hall that will be used for the <a href="table.html"><b>CAPTION</b> table</a> and some of
   the workshops, and the Fusion Arts rooms that will hold our
   workshops and discussion panels.  The bar was being refurbished
   last time we were there, and we managed then, so it should be
   fabulous this year!
</p>
<p>Cowley Road itself is more stuffed with  pubs, take-aways, and
   restaurants than a pomegranate is with pips, so we are confident
   that when the time comes for dinner you will surly find something
   to suit your taste in food. There are also handy sandwich shops
   and a Tescos where you can forage for lunchtime sustenance.
</p>
<p>The Oxford Tube coach from London has a stop at St Clements, and
   it is <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;saddr=OX4+1AR&amp;daddr=ox4+1hu&amp;sll=51.748995,-1.24015&amp;sspn=0.003049,0.006394&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;ll=51.748995,-1.24015&amp;spn=0.006098,0.012789&amp;om=1">a short walk</a> to the Community Centre in a
   few minutes.  This coach and most other coaches terminate in
   Gloucester Green bus station, which is less than 2 miles from the
   venue on foot.  The Railway Station is reasonably well-served, and
   is <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?saddr=Park+End+St,+Oxford,+OX1+1HS+(Oxford+Railway+Station)+%4051.753376,-1.270097&amp;daddr=ox4+1hu&amp;f=l&amp;hl=en&amp;dq=railway+station+loc:+oxford&amp;cid=51753376,-1270097,11458465819521172612&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=14&amp;ll=51.750839,-1.253729&amp;spn=0.02439,0.051155&amp;om=1">2.3 miles away</a> according to Google maps, call it a
   45-minute stroll through the touristy centre of Oxford.
</p>
<p>Visitors coming by motor car are advised that parking is scarce in
   Oxford, especially in the East Oxford area. If you don't have more luggage than you
   can carry, the <a href="http://www.oxford.gov.uk/transport/park-and-ride.cfm">Park and Ride</a> may be convenient: The one from
   Thornhill Park and Ride stops on St Clements, from which it is
   <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=d&amp;hl=en&amp;saddr=OX4+1AR&amp;daddr=ox4+1hu&amp;sll=51.748995,-1.24015&amp;sspn=0.003049,0.006394&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;ll=51.748995,-1.24015&amp;spn=0.006098,0.012789&amp;om=1">a short walk</a> to the Community Centre. There is a
   <a href="http://www.parkandride.net/oxford/html/oxford_frameset.html">jazzy on-line timetable</a> available.      <br>
