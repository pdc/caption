				<h2>Selling your comics at Caption</h2>
				<div>
<p> <em>Welcome to all prospective <b>CAPTION</b> attendees. 
Even if you’ve been before, keep reading because there 
are a few changes that will, hopefully, make things 
run more efficiently over the weekend.</em> 
</p>
<h3> So, what is ‘The <b>CAPTION</b> Table’?</h3>
<p>Well, it is actually quite a few tables in the main hall.
</p>
<p>It is here that your comics can be left, along with all the others, to be sold. 
</p>
<p>Unlike other conventions, <b>CAPTION</b> provides a ‘Bring and Sell’ service
   that means you are not stuck behind a table for the entire weekend. 
   It also allows you more time to buy other people’s comics, 
   take part in the activities or spend time in the bar.
</p>
<h3> What’s the catch?</h3>
<p>No real catch. We simply <strong>charge 10% commission</strong> from your 
   total sales on the Table.
</p>
<p>However, <b>CAPTION</b> is run by volunteers and we will need 
   some help over the weekend. If you think you’ll miss that 
   ‘other side of the table’ feeling, or have never experienced 
   it before, then email us before hand, or speak up during 
   the weekend, and put yourself down for an hour or two of helping out.
</p>
<p>(Contact us via  <a href="mailto:caption2006@caption.org">caption2006@caption.org</a> for this and other gophering needs)
</p>
<p>Don’t forget, it’s always a good way of promoting your own creations 
   amidst the comic cornucopia…
</p>
<h3> What if I’m only at <b>CAPTION</b> for one day?</h3>
<p>After last year, we realised that quite a few people held off
   buying their comics until Sunday. Unfortunately, they then 
   missed out on some of the titles around on Saturday because 
   their creators had taken them home!
</p>
<p>To, hopefully, mitigate this sorry state of affair, we will 
   be having a defined <strong>‘Saturday Only’ section</strong> of the <b>CAPTION</b> 
   Table on the first day. Therefore everyone will know it is 
   going to be the only time to buy those titles. 
</p>
<p>Be sure to state that you are only around for the one day 
   when you bring your stock to the table.
</p>
<p>Obviously, if you are only going to be about on the Sunday, 
   normal rules and restrictions apply.
</p>
<h3> There’s got to be some pesky paperwork?</h3>
<p>Of course there is, but it’s only a simple form to fill in so
   show we are allowed to sell your comics for you, tally up your 
   sales and work out <b>CAPTION</b>’s commission at the end.  <br> 
</p>
<p>It’s at this stage that you will be given a sellers’ code—this 
   needs to be put on all copies of your comics, so that they can 
   easily be identified as your stock.
</p>
<p>We will provide low-tack stickers (okay, they’re generic post-it 
   notes this year). If you have something you’d like to use instead, 
   feel free to bring it along—just make sure it will stay stuck 
   without damaging the comic!
</p>
<h3> Can I download a form to fill in before I arrive?</h3>
<p> <a href="tableform.pdf">Yes you can</a>! This is the main part of this year’s efficiency drive…
</p>
<p> <a href="tableform.pdf">Download the table form (PDF)</a> 
</p>
<p>By printing it off and filling it in the unshaded areas before 
   you arrive you will save time on the day, which means we can get 
   your comics on sale that much sooner. The shaded areas will be
   filled in, as required, at <b>CAPTION</b>. 
</p>
<p>The sheet actually has two forms on it because many of last year’s 
   attendees wanted a copy of what they had sold over the weekend.  <br>
   If you don’t want a copy, bring the other half along anyway and 
   we’ll make use of it!
</p>
<h3> What if my comic doesn’t have a printed cover price? What if I want to offer a deal?</h3>
<p>Clarity is King! Both for the punter and our helpers.
</p>
<p>It is important that the price you want to charge is clearly stated. 
   You can use the Code Sticker if there is no printed price (or you want to charge a lower-than-cover-price rate for <b>CAPTION</b>)
</p>
<p>Bagging and binding worked well for those wanting to sell sets last year 
   (Don’t forget to bring display copies). Again, the bundles will need 
   to be priced correctly and have their own line on the form.
</p>
<p>However, if you want to offer multi-buy deals on your loose copies 
   then <strong>keep it simple</strong>. There will be limited space for show cards/posters 
   and you will have to include the deal on each of the stickers you write. 
   On your form, you will still have to list the individual titles and 
   then include the offer on the bottom lines - with an asterisk in the Quantity column. Make sure you also mark all of the titles that are part of the offer, with an asterisk. If you are thinking of having more than one offer, then other differentiators will have to be used (but read, and think about, the next sentence).
</p>
<p>As we’ll have to keep track of these offers, 
   I’d suggest that the easiest thing to do is pre-bundle—you know it makes sense…
</p>
<h3> How do I get my money?</h3>
<p>You come and collect your comics. (If you are here for both days, 
   there is no need to do this on Saturday night. they can be left in the, locked,
   main hall overnight)
</p>
<p>We will tally up your sales and calculate what we owe you. 
   (If you were wanting your own copy, now’s the time to take down the details.)
   Once we’ve agreed on the amount, you get your money by signing the final section 
   of the form.
</p>
<p>At the end of both days there may be a queue, so be patient 
   and we’ll be as quick, and efficient, as possible. 
   If you’ve got a train to catch, wave your tickets at us 
   and be grateful that comic creators are such a friendly bunch.
</p>
