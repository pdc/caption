          <h1>CAPTION98 Programme</h1>
          <h2>Thank you for joining us on this sad occasion*</h2>
          <p>
            Welcome to CAPTION, the annual alternative comics convention. We are
            delighted that you have decided to join us in our celebration of all
            things dark, grim and dismal in the comics alternative. This year,
            attractions on offer include discussion of the inspiration available
            in blackness and doom; drawing on the dark in a master-class workshop;
            the chance to shop at oblivion's edge; laugh in the face of
            disaster; and look to the future, as we gaze into the abyss and ask,
            what next for the small press, for CAPTION, and for comics?
          </p>
          <p align="right"><small>* Limited quantities of hilarity will be permitted in the bar.</small></p>
          <h2>The last convention booklet you'll ever need*</h2>
          <p>
            This booklet is your essential guide to CAPTION. In it you'll
            find a programme for the events of the weekend; a shopping guide
            profiling our stalls; a history of the last six years of CAPTION; a
            look forward to the events which we'll be attending over the next
            year and more, all interspersed with samples of the stunning artwork
            which will be available for you to buy at the charity auction (in aid
            of the Cartoon Art Trust) this evening. There's also some basic
            practical information like a site-guide, a map of the centre of town
            and a guide to local eateries to keep you going over the weekend. So,
            before you do anything else, CAPTION happily suggests that you sit
            down in the bar with a coffee or a beer and have a quick flip through
            the booklet before first. After that, if you have any more questions,
            you can go and find a committee member (in the black t-shirts) or
            gofer (the ones with the black badges) and bother them. Gently.
