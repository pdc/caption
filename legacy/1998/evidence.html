          <h1>CAPTION98 Evidence Bags</h1>
          <p>
            CAPTION98, the UK's largest small press and alternative comics
            convention, is usually home to nothing more emotionally taking than
            light-hearted boozing, shopping an pizza anxieties and shameless
            superhero silliness.  However, this year CAPTION will be six, which
            means we're quite old enough now to explore the rich and scarey topic
            of death.  And we'd like you to be a part of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the main convention discusses the grim end of the comics and zines
            subculture, the death of titles we have known and loved,
            and the sad demise of UKCAC, the Evidence Bags exhibition
            will be looking into the vast and inspirational area of personal
            extinction: the indvidual death of the artist.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd like you to assemble evidence from your own murder site,
            put it into a clear bag, and return it to me.
            Those of you uninterested in violent death may want instead
            to include or portray accoutrements you would like to be buried
            with, a plan for your grave, a cartoon epitath, or any other
            thoughts on your death.  These bags will be on display at
            CAPTION98, where they will be <em>hung from the ceiling</em>,
            so please don't make them too heavy.  Leave the bags open,
            so people can go through them, or opt for a sealed bag,
            just as you please.
          </p>
          <p>
            All contributors will get a photo of the exhibition
            and CAPTION documentation provided you fill in the slip below.
            The eventual fate of the bags is up to you.
            If you're attending CAPTION, you can take it home afterwards.
            If you want it sent back to you, you must include
            your address and enough stamps or money in the package
            to cover return postage.  Or you can let us dispose of it,
            either to the charity auction (in support of the Cartoon
            Art Trust) or to that ultimate receptacle of all dead
            artworks, the bin.  In the absence of instructions,
            we'll assume you want us to deal with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            CAPTION98 is on 25-26 July 1998 in the Oxford Union, a convenient
            and pleasant site in central Oxford, within easy walking distance
            of the bus and train stations.  Membership is £7&#183;50/£5
            for the weekend, and includes a packed programme of
            discussion, entertainment, and workshops, the opportunity
            to buy the best of alternative and small-press comics and zines,
            and to sell your own titles, as well as a booklet, badge, and plenty
            of advice on local B&amp;Bs.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the lasy five years, we will also be looking for pieces of
            artwork to auction in aid of the Cartoon Art Trust, and to appear in the
            convention booklet.  If you would like to supply a piece
            for the auction, or if you have any questions about
            the exhibition, send mail to
            <s>caption98&#64;alleged.demon.co.uk</s>, or
            <s>use our feedback form</s>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Send your Evidence Bag to Jeremy Dennis, <s>9 Belvedere Road,
            Oxford OX4&nbsp;2AZ</s>.  This is an open exhibition;
