          <h1>Running conventions the CAPTION way</h1>
          <p>
            We want you to run conventions. We want you to find young,
            impressionable comics fans full of enthusiasm and energy and force
            them to set up comics events in your own home town. Why? Because
            we've been at it for seven years now and we want to spread the
            joy, because we love an excuse to visit other peoples' parties,
            and because we're getting tired of watching as conventions which
            look like they might just take over from us fizzle and die within
            the three-year. This is the CAPTION guide to keeping on going:
            seven golden rules, with comments from former and current
            committee members:
          </p>
          <h2>1. TELL PEOPLE ABOUT IT</h2>
          <p>
            The more people you tell about your event, the realler it
            becomes. It's not just a question of publicity: you're forced to
            live up to people's expectations.
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><strong>Adrian Cox:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              I actually attended a course on convention
              running for SF fans. It was... semi useful. At the beginning
              CAPTION was run very like an SF con, but we had to change lots of
              things. It's about half-way between UKCAC and an SF Con now, which
              seems to work fine.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <h2>2. KEEP COMMITTEE SMALL</h2>
          <p>
            Don't turn down offers of help (unless they'll be blatantly
            harmful) but keep the decision-making body as small as possible --
            it helps speed up decisions and leads to less confusion over who's
            doing what.
          </p>

              <img src="matt/damian-thumb.jpg" alt="" align="left" width="70" height="100" />
              There's a
              <a href="http://www.smof.org/">SMOF web-page</a>
              (Secret Masters of Fandom -- people who run SF cons)
              which gives some useful advice among the obvious stuff.

          <br clear="all" />
          <h2>3. OPEN AN ACCOUNT FOR IT</h2>
          <p>
            Separate finances are relatively simple if you stick with being
            a non-profit making organisation -- no need to worry about taxes,
            some breaks on bank charges. But what this really gives is impetus
            to keep on going -- with the hundred or so left over from last
            year's convention, which of course isn't profit, as you're a
            non-profit making organisation...
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt><strong>Gideon Nisbet:</strong></dt>
            <dd>
              I've always found those WWII movies with
              German Submarines and people yelling 'Dive! Dive!' very
              inspirational when it comes to con-running.
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <h2>4. MAKE SURE OF YOUR SITE</h2>
          <p>
            Sites make or break a convention. They should be your biggest
            expense and your biggest worry. CAPTION's success has depended
            heavily on its cheap and agreeable site.
          </p>

              I'm boringly self-taught, except for some
              good tips from Alan Jeffrey's Style over Content credit-card sized
              micro-comic. I should do another one of them for CAPTION. Will I
              have time?
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <br clear="all" />
          <h2>5. QUANTITY AND QUALITY</h2>
          <p>
            A guest rule. Guests are a good draw, but if they only talk and
            leave, you've missed out. Ideally they tell other people about it,
            bother their friends to come, perform well, and drag people along
            on the day. There are people who do this. We love them.

              I learnt my winning ways at my mother's knee
              -- and playing football as a little girl helped me learn to kick
              people to get them to do things. Persuading my school (aged 8)
              that girls should be allowed to play football at all was a good
              start too, of course...
            </dd>
          </dl>
          <br clear="all" />
          <h2>6. HOSPITALITY MATTERS</h2>
          <p>
            The bar. Somewhere to have an evening meal. Enough to
            do. Somewhere comfortable to hang around and not do much. Members
            are guests and need to be treated accordingly, with respect and
            care.
          </p>

              I'd like to say that my goose-herding
              skills prepared me for con-running, but getting cartoonists to do
              anything is more akin to herding cats... most other inspiration
              came from looking at what pissed me off at other events, and
              trying to figure out feasible ways to make things work differently
              -- the way I'd like -- with varying levels of success.

          <h2>7.DON'T BE OVER-AMBITIOUS</h2>
          <p>
            With any event, there's always more you could do, with more
            people/time/effort/ whatever. Work out what's vital to do and
            focus on that. The rest can wait for next time, or be brought in
            later if you have time.
          </p>

              Worryingly enough, I still refer to that
              episode of Sandman which is set at a Serial Killer's
              convention. It's full of useful ideas about all sorts: talks,
              events, guests, what to do if things go wrong....
