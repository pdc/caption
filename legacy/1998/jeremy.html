          <p>1998 was our last chance to kill off Caption before it dragged us into the next millennium, so we chose death as our theme: both the idea that inspiration can come from death and darkness, and the thought that comics generally and the small press in particular are a  genre in danger of dying a pauper&rsquo;s death as popular media like television and computer games take over. We were a cheery lot, last year.</p>
          
          <p>But I thought it was brilliant &mdash; an excuse to do a really gruesome exhibition. So I set about inviting people to send in evidence bags from their own murder scene. Being a cowardly, superstitious lot, many comiceers felt uncomfortable with the idea, but I got enough to fill a corridoor with tagged bags of weird detritus &mdash; tattered toys, scraps of writing, collages and illustrations, along with the inevitable scalpels, tissue samples, unidentified pills, and blood-stained pieces of glass. Ouch! So many people failed to get their bags done I left out post-it notes for them to put their ideas on. The resulting catalogue of conceptual doom included such fates as &lsquo;choked on a mackerel&rsquo;, &lsquo;airbrushed out&rsquo;, and &lsquo;watched all six episodes of Invasion Earth.&rsquo;</p>
          
          <p><a href="matt/steve-whitaker.html" title="Steve Whitaker"><img src="matt/whitkoworkshop1-thumb.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="100" height="62" />Steve Whitaker</a>&rsquo;s white-on-black workshop provided a good excuse to muck around with some very unfamiliar materials: white emulsion paint on black sugar paper. The combination of crude materials and working in negative produced some strange and amazing pictures: <a href="matt/lee-kennedy.html" title="Lee Kennedy"><img src="matt/whitkoworkshop2-thumb.jpg" alt="" align="left" width="68" height="100" />Lee Kennedy</a>&rsquo;s deathly vision of dark Teletubbies was unforgettable.</p>
          
          <p>I hadn&rsquo;t seen the paper left in the bar put to such good use for years. I&rsquo;d managed to find a long roll of paper in a cheapie bookstore, and all the artists set to work turning it into the sort of frieze that would never find its way onto a toddler&rsquo;s wall. Beer stains, dirty jokes, and particularly beautiful art from, among others, <a href="matt/sean-bieri.html" title="Sean Bieri"><img src="matt/bieri-thumb.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="74" height="100" />Sean Bieri</a>, Nik Abadzis, D&rsquo;Israeli, and Ed Hillyer made for scribble pads to be remembered.</p>
          
          <p>The auction is always a bit stressful, with some of my own pieces for sale, and always one or two things I really want. Fortunately I had the distraction of meeting Steve Green, founder of the APA I&rsquo;m in, to get my mind off the bidding &mdash; which, as usual, got a bit fraught around some favourite items. Still, that&rsquo;s where we raise the money.</p>
          
          <p>Sunday was beautifully languid, even sunnier than the Saturday had been, and I spent most of the day in the garden with cool beer, good friends and far too many brilliant new comics to look through. Almost like being a punter even. Except that they didn&rsquo;t have to worry about getting six four-by-four boards home at the end of the day...</p>
