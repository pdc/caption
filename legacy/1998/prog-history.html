                  Summer 1991.  I'm in the middle of an essay, in the middle of
                  Oxford, the middle of a heat wave. Blame it on the heat, but
                  Adrian Cox comes into my room and says, 'Hey, I've just had a
                  great idea. Why don't we run our own comics convention?' I look at
                  him dubiously. An erstwhile SF fan organiser, he has one abortive
                  convention to his name so far. 'No,' he says, 'listen,' he says,
                  'I really think we can make it work.'
                </p>
                <p>
                  We could. Arch mover-and-shaker Jenni Scott found us a guest
                  list. Technological expertise from Damian Cugley got us badges and
                  leaflets. A brainwave from Gideon Nisbet got us a site. Then the
                  enthusiasm and support we got from the comics scene took over and
                  sealed CAPTION's fate. It was confused, it was disorganised, it
                  even rained. But it was an enormous success and everyone had a
                  great time. Which just left one question; how do you get it right
                  again, when you don't know what you did right the first time?
                </p>
                <h2>CAPTION93: Getting it wrong</h2>
                <p>
                  We tried everything. We even tried giving our profits to the
                  London Cartoon Centre. No luck; they wanted us to run another
                  convention instead. So we decided it was time to get real, and
                  beefed up the convention accordingly. A dealers and exhibition
                  hall, a packed programme, contact with the media, lots more work
                  for everyone. Just like a real convention. Trouble was, people
                  weren't there for huge exhibitions to track round or stalls
                  selling mint Spidermen. They didn't want to have to chose between
                  four different things to go to. What did they want? We tried to
                  find out with a questionnaire, which revealed that they wanted
                  another CAPTION. And they wanted it done right this time... but
                  they'd leave the details up to us.
                </p>
                <h2>CAPTION94: Going underground</h2>
                <p>
                  CAPTION94 we decided to concentrate on strengths rather than
                  going for wider appeal. A powerful theme (sex, drugs and
                  rock'n'roll) and a grant from Southern Arts gave us a good start,
                  but the real gains came from figuring out what people liked most
                  and concentrating on them. Shopping scored high, so we made sure
                  our favourite dealers had space and helpers. Capricorn comics,
                  Slab-O-Concrete, and the CAPTION Table had a brilliant year. A
                  full workshop programme included a 'brass tacks' workshop about
                  comics printing, as well as Steve Whitaker's master class. The
                  real triumph, though, was the panel room. From the Five men on
                  drugs panelists who had to be dragged in from the garden where
                  they're having a quiet smoke, to the National Theatre of Earth
                  Prime's performance of Baron Winter's House Party, it was a good
                  day for talking. The icing on the cake was raising enough money to
                  keep the London Cartoon Centre open for another term. Happy days!
                </p>
                <h2>CAPTION95: Out and arty</h2>
                <p>
                  We had a good base of people coming, we had a good theme, we
                  had good support from our friends and helpers, and regular
                  publicity from Caption magazine; all of which left me with enough
                  time to start thinking about how to get an exhibition back into
                  CAPTION. The Dirty Laundry mail-art exhibition got more people
                  involved, and allowed regulars who couldn't attend to come in
                  proxy by sending artworks. In the meantime we'd managed to get a
                  brilliant set of guests, Steve Whitaker's light and shade workshop
                  produced stunning artworks, and I had the privilege of chairing
                  the first queer comics panel I'd ever attended. A truly brilliant
                  year all round.
                </p>
                <h2>CAPTION96: Employment strikes</h2>
                <p>
                  By 1996, even I was employed. We just didn't have the time or
                  the energy left over any more to bust a gut trying to get a
                  convention together. On the other hand, as Adrian pointed out, we
                  didn't have to. The infrastructure was all in place, we had copies
                  of all the right forms, there were plenty of people who wanted to
                  come already. Could we do a slacker convention? We could. People
                  continued to attend in proxy, this time as cardboard dollies of
                  themselves (which sold very well at the auction!), the National
                  Theatre of Earth Prime did a well-received re-run of Robin Lives
                  with Bruce and Alfred and, finding ourselves short of time to laze
                  around in the sun in we extended the convention to
                  Sunday. Gorgeous.
                </p>
                <h2>CAPTION97: The European one</h2>
                <p>
                  In 1997, funded by the nation lottery and fired by enthusiasm
                  for all things European, we produced our very own shiny comics
                  anthology, invited a plethora of guests from Europe and became the
                  best-dressed committee ever in stunning Steve Martin-designed
                  t-shirts.  Surprised by how well everything was working, the
                  committee wandered around fruitlessly waiting for disaster to
                  strike, while the staff on the Caption Table worked out precise
                  exchange rates for the European Comics Unit. Sunday in the garden
                  was defiantly sunny, again, and we wondered how our luck could
                  possibly hold for another year.
                </p>
                <h2>CAPTION98: Is it the end?</h2>
                <p>
                  Have you spotted the pattern yet? A complicated CAPTION is
                  always followed by a slack one, and this year's is no
                  exception. All the committee have jobs now, not to mention houses,
                  fish or tomato plants to look after. Will 1998 see the first rainy
                  CAPTION? Will we finally have a dull panel? Could it be... the
                  end?
                </p>
                <h2><a href="../1999/">SPACECAPTION1999</a>: The future</h2>
                <p>
                  Dead, ha! Actually, we're already planning next year. Dust off
                  your lurex and dig out your white polyester jumpsuits as CAPTION
                  looks to the future.
