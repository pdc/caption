          <h1>Deconstructing classics:<br> Introducing the National Theatre of Earth-Prime</h1>
          <p>
            Ludicrous superheroics. Soft toy mayhem. In-joke crammed
            rip-offs of mainstream successes. Not very alternative, is it? Not
            very small press? Wrong. Every culture has its sacred cows, and
            slaughtering them is the job of the alternative fringe; and that's
            the National Theatre of Earth Prime.
          </p>
          <p>
            Founded in 1991 to rip apart main man Alan Moore's vicious
            novel <cite>Watchmen</cite>, the Theatre succeeded brilliantly in conveying the
            savage cynicism of the original without losing sight of their own
            uniquely irreverent voice. With the help of a table, a swimming
            hat and the Alan Jeffrey memorial wig (also starring in this
            year's performance) the two men who are the Theatre -- Mark Boyes
            and Jason Stevens -- caught the very essence of the
            original. Penny Heal's brilliant performance as the large
            tentacled thing which trashes New York also impressed, and started
            what would be a series of top cameos.
          </p>
          <p>
            But they needed more. A
            wider audience. A more serious text to work from. Maybe some
            sequins. CAPTION93 saw <cite>Robin Lives with Bruce and Alfred</cite>, a
            creative re-interpretation of Frank Miller's
            <cite>The Dark Knight Returns</cite>,
            which nonetheless was very faithful to the original
            story. <cite>Baron Winter's House Party</cite> followed, giving the definitive
            sub-text for the American Gothic story line in <cite>Swamp Thing</cite>. It
            also introduced the big green bucket, also making an appearance
            this year.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1995 the Theatre expanded its ranks and became The
            Reduced Sandman company, which brought us all of Neil Gaiman's
            <cite>Sandman</cite> -- minus <cite>The Wake</cite>, to avoid too much dozing.
            'It lost its
            purity, with the introduction of so many characters,' said Mark
            Boyes, 'And then there was <cite>The Invisibles</cite>, and things got very
            strange.' A Theatre 'B' list production, this bloated and decadent
            take on Grant Morrison's super-hip series featured rampant
            baldness, scrumpy snakebite smart-drinks and a chorus of
            bloodthirsty mutant badgers.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this year's CAPTION sees a
            leaner, fitter Theatre of Earth Prime confidently preparing to
            take on master of revenge and gothiness, <cite>The Crow</cite>, with only a
            stuffed duck and a big coat to help them. We can't wait. So, what
            next for the Theatre? A version of Scott McCloud's
            <cite>Understanding Comics</cite>?
            'We always say that we're going to do <cite>Luther Arkwright</cite>
            next,' says Mark Boyes, 'But then, we've been threatening that for
            years.'
