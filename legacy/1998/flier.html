          <h2>ANNOUNCING THE DEATH OF CAPTION</h2>
          <p>
            CAPTION, the annual alternative comics convention, is back
            for a sixth triumphant year.  CAPTION is a non-profit-making
            convention that aims to combine the best and brightest of the small
            press and alternative talent, people and product with large quantites
            of beer and sunshine.  It's proved a winning format since 1992, so in
            true comics book fashion we have decided that the best thing to do to
            a good thing is kill it, and so this year we will acconrdingly be looking
            into death: the death of CAPTION, the death of the small press, and
            the death of comics generally.  Let's get grim!
          </p>
          <h2>An invitation to the hottest wake of the small press year</h2>
          <p>
            CAPTION is a two-day event held in the Oxford Union, an
            attractive and accessible site in the middle of Oxford, within easy
            walking distance of the bus and train stations.  The first day will be
            given over to discussion in the death panels, self-expression in a
            dark and brooding workshop, and examination of the Evidence Bags
            exhibition.  The evening programme will combine black comedy, a cheap
            bar, and the opportunity to pick up stunning peices of artwork for a
            song at the CAPTION Cartoon Art Trust auction.  The Sunday programme
            offers the chance for leisurely dissection of Saturday's
            entertainment, or you can look to the future with our Generation Next
            panel.  Shopping opportunities will be provided by our tried and
            tested stalls, open for most of the weekend to sell alternative and
            underground comics from all over the world, as well as hard-to-get
            titles and camp classics.  CAPTION also provides a table on which any
            convention member can leave their own titles.  Stuff sells fast from
            it, and its staffed by CAPTION volunteers, allowing you to enjoy the
            convention; payment is just 10% of the cover price.  The bar is open
            throughout the weekend.
