            <p>
              This is your official invitation to <strong class="logo">spacecaption1999</strong>, this
              year's glitzy incarnation of the UK's longest-running alternative
              comics convention. Over the past six years Caption has
              successfully combined the best and brightest of small press and
              alternative talent, people and product with large quantities of
              beer and sunshine. This year, we've added tin-foil, silver
              grease-paint and rockets on strings to the mix to bring you a
              celebration of alternative comics which looks both backwards and
              forwards to the future in small press comics. So, haul out your
              silver jumpsuits, blow the dust off your ray-gun, and come and
              burn off your excess millennium fever at Caption, the annual
              get-together for small press comiceers everywhere.

            <p>
              spacecaption1999 is a non-profit making convention held over
              two days in the Oxford Union, a comfy and pleasant site in the
              middle of Oxford, within easy walking distance of the bus and
              train stations. Day one -- Saturday -- starts at ten with
              introductions and coffee at the bar, before moving on at around
              noon into the programme of events.
              Shoot the moon at our panel
              discussions, indulge in a little inner-space exploration at our
              artists workshop, or simply wander around looking at stars,
              rockets and little space-ships in Caption's exhibition. Throughout
              the day various exotic and otherworldly goods will be on sale from
              Caption's star dealers, and you can also sell your own comics,
              without the inconvenience of having to sit behind a table, from
              the Caption Table. Also running throughout the day, small
              discussion groups will be looking at practical topics like
              distribution, event-running, getting published and the like, so if
              you want to share ideas, get encouragement or find out more, turn
              up to talk it over with someone who's been there already. If all
              this sounds like far too much work, there's always the bar and the
              garden -- safe retreats, well stocked with art materials and pads.

              The evening programme kicks off with another opportunity to
              shop: the CAPTION Cartoon Art Trust charity auction. It's been
              full of wonderful things for the past six years, and, with your
              help, it will be again this year. Turn to the centre pages to find
              out how to donate artwork or other items. Later still, Caption
              regulars 'The Theatre of Earth Prime' will be scrutinising another
              comics classic -- in all probability,
              <a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/">Scott McCloud</a>'s
              <cite>Understanding Comics</cite>. Oh, the insanity.

              Sunday starts slow, and we won't expect anyone to be up to
              rational discussion before one, when the main panel takes
              place. This year it's on speculation and the creative
              process. Sounds scary? Come and find out whether your best ideas
              are being beamed into your head by aliens. Other attractions on
              the Sunday include a second chance to visit our dealers' tables,
              more small discussion groups, and a glittery workshop, just like
              you used to have at playgroup. Many people, however, just use
              Sunday as a chance to kick back and relax with their mates, so
              don't feel under any pressure to do anything. If you want to laze
              about, you'll be in good company.

              Caption's guest list is everyone who turns up, since our members
              tend to be small-pressers, comics artists, cartoonists, and other
              people involved in the production or promotion of comics. But,
              this year, as ever, we have some bright, beautiful and
              entertaining people helping us out on panels or in other
              events. Comics legend
              <a href="http://www.bryan-talbot.com/">Bryan Talbot</a>
              will be there, to talk about
              <a href="http://www.bryan-talbot.com/heart.of.empire.home.html"><cite>Heart of Empire</cite></a>
              (to be published by <a href="http://www.dhorse.com/">Dark Horse</a>)
              and his life in comics. Also, look out for cult
              cartoonist Steven Appleby, co-creator of everyone's favourite
              whingeing rocket captain, Captain Star. It's early days yet, but
              the rest of the guests will be a mix of new faces and Caption
              regulars, like
