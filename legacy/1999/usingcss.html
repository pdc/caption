      <h2>What happened?</h2>
      <p>
        In the aftermath of spacecaption1999 I finished off its
        little web site, changing all the text to use the past tense and
        adding the photo albums donated by Matt and Gideon.
        Now, in March 2001, I have reformatted it
        to remove the use of HTML tables to do layout,
        substituting the use of cascading stylesheets (CSS)
        and XHTML (HTML&nbsp;4).
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that these pages will look their best in a
        web browser that supports web standards&mdash;such as Microsoft
        Internet Explorer  5.5 (Windows version) or 5 (Macintosh version),
        Mozilla 0.7 or later, or Netscape Navigator 6.
        In browsers that don&rsquo;t support CSS at all, this site should
        look like  a plain information site&mdash;text in your default font
        on your default background.  The lack of table trickery may even
        make it
        easier to read on some browsers (screen readers,
        PDAs, or whatever).
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is that the layout may go doolally on web browsers that
        <em>think</em> they can handle CSS but in fact cannot.  This includes
        Netscape Navigator 4 and Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3&ndash;4.
        In the ones I have tried, the text is still readable, but the layout is
        frankly peculiar.   You may be better off switching off stylesheet
        handling altogether (In Navigator, Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced
        -> Enable Style Sheets; in Internet Explorer, start with View ->
        Preferences or Tools -> Internet Preferences depending on version).
      </p>
      <h2>Why have you done this thing?</h2>
      <p>
        The <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/">Web Standards Project</a>
        is trying to encourage people to
        <a href="http://www.webstandards.org/upgrade/">upgrade to standards-adherent
        browsers</a>.  They outline their reasons there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have another reason, apart from wanting to be able to
        take advantage of the newer standards: by trimming out the verbose
        HTML trickery I used to use, and rescaling some of the photo-album
        images, I have shaved almost a megabyte from this section of my site.
        Since I am limited to 20&nbsp;Mbytes total, and am currently pushing 18,
        this is a space saving worth making.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the new format is more friendly to screen readers
        and text-only browsers, I no longer need a special text-only version
        of pages&mdash;which halves the number of HTML files.
      </p>
      <p>I hope this does not cause too much incovenience to readers.</p>
