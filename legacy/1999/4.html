        August 1999, in the Oxford Union, St Michael's Street,
        Oxford, OX1, which is just off the main shopping
        street, five-ten minute's walk from the train station
        and three minute's walk from the bus station. The site
        will open at 10am on Saturday for coffee, and the bar
        will be fully open from 11am to 11pm, when the site
        will close for the night. The site will reopen 11am
        Sunday morning with a full bar through to 5.30pm
        Sunday afternoon. The site will close at 6pm on
        Sunday.

      <p>
        Buy your advance memberships using the form on the
        back of the flier. Standard advance membership is
        £7.50 waged, £5.00 unwaged. Membership on the door
        costs £10, no reductions. Supporters can buy a Friend
        of Caption membership at a cost of £15, to help
        provide the money required to get
        <a href="../c2000/">Caption 2000</a> started
        next year. If you can't make Saturday, the
        'wage-slavers' Sunday-only membership will set you
        back £3.00, no reductions. We can't guarantee main
        guests or programme books for Sunday, but it's a lot
        of fun otherwise. Caption t-shirts, and our anthology,
        Superstate Funnies, will be on sale on the Caption
        table. Numbers of t-shirts are limited, so if you
        really want one, buy one in advance, using the form on
        the back.
