            <p>
              The best thing you can do for us is turn up at the
              convention, so mark it in your diaries now. The
              membership form on the back page lists the different
              memberships, from 'Friend of Caption' to the
              'Wage-slave Special'. Joining in advance is cheaper,
              and gets you more information, but every year people
              successfully decide to come at the last minute. If you
              want to turn up in costume -- this might, after all,
              be your only chance to wear that silver jump-suit this
              millennium -- go for it. Some people will be in
              costume, some won't, and some, though they look like
              they're in costume, actually always dress like
              that. Follow your inner directives.

              Is there somewhere near you where you could leave
              fliers or put up posters for Caption? Do you have any
              friends you think might fancy coming? Caption, as
              small conventions often do, gets a lot of its most
              useful publicity via word of mouth, so if you're
              going, do let people know. You can get fliers and
              posters from us, or if you know someone you think
              would like to know about Caption, you can photocopy
              any bits of this leaflet or write, phone or email us
              (details below) and get us to send them one. Updates
              and more information will also be available on our
              website; to see the latest progress check out

            auction to raise money to help the Cartoon Art Trust
            run cartooning courses. If you can provide us with
            artwork to auction, or donations of any other unusual
            or interesting items, we'll be absurdly grateful. To
            reproduce art from the charity auction in Caption's
            book we need to receive it by August 1st, so please
            get your pieces in early -- and let Jeremy know
            they're coming on 01865 721638. Items on a spacey
            theme are especially welcome this year, but anything
            and everything goes!"

              interstellar exhibition. The membership form has space
              for a starry doodle from everyone -- I'll be turning
              the doodles into mobile pieces to hang in the
              corridors at Caption -- but anyone who wants to do
              anything more complicated, please let me know (Jeremy
              on 01865 721638) and then do it. Please be advised
              that unless you specifically ask otherwise, original
              artwork may wind up being sold in our charity
              auction. Speaking of which:

            <p>
              One of the best things about Caption is the
              variety and range of small press comics on sale. We'd
              like you to help us keep it that way by bringing your
              own work along to sell. The process is simple: just
              drop off your comics with the Caption Table gofers,
              let them check details with you, and then go off and
              enjoy the convention. At the end of the day (6pm) go
              back to pick up money and left-over comics. When you
              need comics for freebies or swaps, let the gofer on
              the table know before you take them. Remember: you
              have until 21 August to make a comic to sell at
              Caption. So get scribbling!

        We want Caption to be useful, interesting and fun for all our
        members. If you have any ideas, any workshops or discussion
        meetings you'd like to see or could lead, please get in touch. The
        best way is by emailing
        <s><em>caption99@alleged.demon.co.uk</em></s> but you can
        also write to Caption, <s>24 Campbell Road, Oxford, OX4 3PF</s>, or leave
        a short message on <s>Jeremy's ansaphone on 01865 721638</s>. We would be
        particularly interested to hear from you if you can help us out
        with publicity, eg. by publishing articles, placing adverts,
        displaying posters, or getting leaflets out to interested
        people.
