      <p><em>
      A slightly belated convention report for CAPTION99, held last weekend
      (21&ndash;22 August) in Oxford, UK.
      </em></p>
      
      <p>We’ve been holding  CAPTION since 1992,
      and I guess it shows. On the one
      hand there was a comfortable atmosphere, with people very much enjoying
      their annual meet, greet, &amp; drink up. On the other hand, the organisers
      were tired&mdash;only one main guest, only one panel each day. It’s turned
      into the annual overgrown pub meet of the UK independent comics scene,
      with a few sidelines thrown in.</p>
      
      <p>The theme this year was
      spacecaption1999&mdash;shiny silver space rockets
      ahoy! The exhbition reflected this nicely&mdash;attendees were asked to send
      in space debris, which was enlarged, stuck onto card, coloured, and hung
      up for brightly-clad (and indeed space-suited) guests to wander around
      through. As always, this made a great contrast with the sober photos in
      the Oxford Union Society venue&mdash;these photos feature besuited Union
      committees from years past, with luminaries such as Tuppy Owens, Mother
      Teresa, and Mr Malcolm X represented amongst younger versions of various
      right-wing MPs.</p>
      
      <p>The main guest this year was
      <a href="matt/bryan-talbot.html"><strong>Bryan Talbot</strong><img src="matt/bryantalbot-bryana-icon.png" align="left" alt="" width="44" height="64" /></a>, taking time out from the inking
      of the final pages of Heart of Empire. He gave a very interesting and
      well-received slideshow presentation on storytelling in <cite>One Bad Rat</cite>; it
      went into quite a bit of detail on the tricks and techniques he used
      throughout the book. For instance, superhero comics are usually drawn with
      the reader’s eyeline below that of the hero or villain --giving the
      impression of looking up at the character and hence the impression of
      power inherent in that character. In
      <cite>One Bad Rat</cite>, the eyeline is at the
      main character’s own level, defusing that power-relationship. Or to take
      another example&mdash;the colour red is reserved in <cite>One Bad Rat</cite>
      for scenes
      depicting the abuse that the main character, Helen, undergoes, so that
      those scenes are visually marked as well as textually.</p>
      
      <p>It was a very impressive presentation, but it did leave me with the
      question of how effective these techniques actually are. They make sense,
      and they sound like they should work, but it would be very interesting if
      there were some independent research into the effect that they actually
      have. Call me a picky scientist!</p>
      
      <p>We also had a couple of overseas attendees&mdash;<a href="matt/martin-wisse.html"><strong>Martin Wisse</strong><img src="matt/guests-martinwissea-icon.png" align="right" alt="" width="44" height="64" /></a> from the
      Netherlands (on Reinder Dykhuis’ recommendation, I believe),
      <strong>Jean-Paul Jennequin</strong>
      from France, who is quite a regular now, and
      <strong>Fabio Gadducci</strong>, who
      is one of the organisers of the Lucca festival in Italy. It’s always good
      to make new links and see some more stuff from other parts of the world,
      so it was great that these people managed to make it to CAPTION.</p>
      
      <p>There were also the usual UK suspects attending&mdash;
      <strong>Pete Ashton</strong>,
      <strong>Pete Pavement</strong>, and
      <strong>Howard Stangroom</strong> with their various comics stalls selling,
      respectively, general independent comics,
      <a href="http://www.slab-o-concret.demon.co.uk/">Slab-O-Concrete</a>’s best new
      material, and tacky 60s DC mixed with romance and queer comics.
      <a href="matt/paul-gravett.html"><strong>Paul Gravett</strong><img src="matt/guests-woodspaulg-icon.png" align="left" alt="" width="64" height="44" /></a> was there&mdash;wouldn’t be the same without him&mdash;and
      <strong>Guy Lawley</strong>,
      who always helps bump up the auction total&mdash;and <strong>Nick Abadzis</strong>, though he
      has been working almost exclusively in children’s books rather than
      comics. <a href="matt/woodrow-phoenix.html"><strong>Woodrow Phoenix</strong></a> (but no
      <strong>Ed Hillyer</strong> this year), <a href="matt/martin-hand.html"><strong>Martin Hand</strong><img src="matt/guests-martinhand-icon.png" align="right" alt="" width="43" height="64" /></a> &amp;
      <a href="matt/jenni-cole.html"><strong>Jenni Cole</strong><img src="matt/guests-jennicole-icon.png" align="left" alt="" width="43" height="64" /></a>,
      <a href="matt/terry-wiley.html"><strong>Terry Wiley</strong><img src="matt/terrydave-spacesuits2-icon.png" align="right" alt="" width="64" height="44" /></a> &amp; <a href="matt/dave-mckinnon.html"><strong>Dave McKinnon</strong></a>
      from
      <a href="http://www.tycho.clara.net/sleaze_castle/"><cite>Sleaze Castle</cite></a>
      (wearing the best spacesuits I’ve
      seen),
      <strong>Rachel House</strong> and
      <a href="matt/jo-david.html"><strong>Jo David</strong><img src="matt/guests-rachael-icon.png" align="left" alt="" width="64" height="43" /></a> (Rachel’s new issue of <cite>Red Hanky Panky</cite> is
      out now, with a flipdoublecoverspecialotherhalf giving us the return of
      <strong>Mark Connorton</strong>’s <cite>Hormone Frenzy</cite>),
      <strong>Sina</strong>,
      <strong>Andy Konky Kru</strong>,
      <a href="matt/matt-brooker.html"><strong>Matt Brooker</strong><img src="matt/mattbygideon-matt-icon.png" align="right" alt="" width="60" height="64" /></a> (<a href="disraeli/">D’Israeli</a>),
      and many more. One new person we were particularly
      pleased to see was <strong>Lee Davies</strong>, the guy who started the UK’s first head
      shop in the 60s. He was <a href="matt/bryan-talbot.html"><strong>Bryan Talbot</strong></a>’s first publisher and in fact is
      republishing <cite>Brainstorm Comix</cite> in October this year.</p>
      
      <p>Much of the day was taken up with chatting and sitting in the sun (with
      the odd break for Bryan’s lecture and <a href="matt/steve-whitaker.html"><strong>Steve Whitaker</strong><img src="matt/captioncrew-gavinsteve-icon.png" align="left" alt="" width="64" height="44" /></a>’s usual fine
      workshop). In the evening there was the traditional entertainment of the
      National Theatre of Earth Prime, mangling another comics classic. This
      time the chosen work was, of course,
      <cite>The Adventures of Luther Arkwright</cite>;
      the first time such a work has been done in front of the original author.
      Phew&mdash;Bryan loved it&mdash;he was heard laughing louder than anyone else.
      Well, apparently&mdash;I could hardly tell, I was laughing too hard to
      notice.</p>
      
      <p>Before that, however, we held the charity auction, raising money for the
      educational work done by the Cartoon Art Trust. Thanks to some lovely
      artwork, generous bidders, and steely glares from our gophers, we raised
      over 1,000 pounds! (I rather disturbingly found at the end of it that I’d
      ended up spending £100 myself&mdash;obviously there was far too much tempting
      stuff...)</p>
      
      <p>The Sunday is a day of rest, with sunbathing as a program item (held in
      the bar if wet). There was one actual panel&mdash;creating your own world, a
      discussion of consistency and rigour in creating one’s comics universe. On
      the panel were Bryan Talbot again&mdash;very rigorous, to the extent of
      knowing what would be in a drawer in a room the reader never sees&mdash;Terry
      &amp; Dave from <cite>Sleaze Castle</cite>&mdash;moderately rigorous, with a proper timeline
      but happy to fudge some things&mdash;and D’Israeli, who is more of the school
      of taking an idea and stretching the world to fit it in. (That’s how he
      ends up with flesh-eating radioactive haddocks, y’see.)</p>
      
      <p>This light panel item over, the day wound to a pleasurably drunken close,
      at which point we were able to declare CAPTION officially finished.</p>
      
      <p>Finished? Yes, we often say that this is the last year, we’ll never do it
      again&mdash;and find ourselves foresworn as temptation bites us in the
      unprotected rear. This year we mean it. Honest. And we’re going to spend
      our surplus just to make sure we’re not tempted again. (Call it a
      dividend.) However, faced with this dire threat of NO MORE CAPTION, some
      of the younger generation were seen getting together and plotting&mdash;so
      keep alert for possibilities in the future... I’m sure they’ll let you
      know.</p>
