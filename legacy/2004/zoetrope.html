          <p> This year 2004, on the fine summer's weekend of the 14-15 August, we may look
          forward to the 12th appearance of Caption, the United Kingdom's longest-running
          Alternative and Independent Comics Convention, this year taking place in the
          new venue of Wolfson College, Linton St., Oxford. In this location of glorious,
          nay, shocking modernity there will be on display a wonder of the mechanickal
          age; a veritable forest of extraordinary comics zoetropes. </p>

            What is this &#8220; zoetrope &#8221; of which you
            speak?
          </h2>
          <p>
            A zoetrope is a spinning apparatus through which static pictures may be given
            the appearance of movement. Put simply, a sequence of twelve images drawn to
            follow on from each other are moved in front of the eye at speed, and through
            the persistence of vision, become a short moving image, or &#8220; movie &#8221;
            as the popular taste has it. Caption is eager to obtain pictures from a great
            number of talented individuals, and this sheet is your invitation to participate.

          <h2>Very well, what must I do?</h2>
          <p>
            To place your
            own tree within the zoetrope forest, you must send, to the address below, no
            fewer than four and no more than twelve images of dimensions no smaller than
            1cm and no greater than 3cm in either direction. All images must be of the same
            size and follow on from each other, to create the illusion of movement. Images
            may be submitted as paper artwork, concept sketches, computer images or animated
            gifs.
          </p>
          
          
          <h2> To whom should I send my art?</h2>
          <p> The organiser of the zoetrope forest is Jeremy Dennis. You may send items
          for the exhibition (or correspondence) to her at the Caption address, <s>which
          is 18 Hawkins Street, Oxford, OX4 1YD</s>. Alternatively you may send her items
          via email to cleanskies@yahoo.co.uk, or converse with her online at cleanskies.livejournal.com.</p>
          <h2> That's a bit bally complicated for my taste, lad!</h2>
          <p> There are many other ways of participating in Caption. We also need historically-themed
          artwork for the charity exhibition and auction. Or you may simply wish to attend.
          Weekend attendance costs &pound;10; cheques payable to Caption, please. For
          other membership options, news about the convention, and other information,
          visit www.caption.org.</p>
