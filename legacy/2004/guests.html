          <h2>Pat Mills</h2>
          <p>
            An important figure in the history of
            British comics. He was
            creator and <a href="http://www.2000adonline.com/index.php3?zone=droid&amp;page=profiles&amp;choice=PATM">first
            editor of
            <cite>2000AD</cite></a>,
            and has continued to write for it (&lsquo;Judge Dredd&rsquo;,
            &lsquo;Sl&aacute;ine&rsquo;, &lsquo;Nemesis the Warlock&rsquo;). Before this he edited
            and contributed to a number of girls&rsquo; comics in the 1970s
            (<cite>Misty</cite>, <cite>Tammy</cite>, <cite>Jinty</cite>).
            Later, he created and wrote for
            <cite>Action</cite> and <cite>Battle</cite>, taking the opportunity to
            produce what he considers one of his strongest and best stories:
            the anti-war story published in a war comic,
            <a href="http://charleyswar.tripod.com/battle/id9.html"><img src="charley1.jpg" align="right" alt="" width="217" height="281" />&lsquo;Charley&rsquo;s War&rsquo;</a>.
            Later highlights include 80s/90s British weekly comic
            <cite>Crisis</cite> for which he wrote the lead strip,
            and the US-based <cite>Marshal Law</cite>
            (co-created with Kevin O&rsquo;Neil). He is currently writing for the
            continental European market and for
            <cite>2000AD</cite>.
