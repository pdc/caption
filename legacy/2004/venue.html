            CAPTION will be held in
            <a href="http://www.wolfson.ox.ac.uk/">Wolfson College, Oxford</a>,

          <h2>Getting there</h2>
          <p>
            Unusually for an Oxford College it is fairly easy to reach by car
            (see <a href="http://www.wolfson.ac.uk/howtogetthere.html">how to get there</a>
            on their web site, including MultiMap directions) and there is a car park.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Train.</strong>  Wolfson is approximately 2 miles from
            the Oxford train station.  From the station, take a bus 2A
            or 2C.  Get off at St Margaret&rsquo;s Road.  Cross
            Banbury Road and turn on to Lindon Road.  Wolfson College
            is at the end of Lindon Road.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Coach.</strong>  Wolfson is about one mile from the
            Gloucester Green bus station.  From the station, walk up
            George Street to Magdalen Street.  Take a bus 2A, 2C or 7
            at the bus stop in front of Borders bookshop and get off
            at St Margaret&rsquo;s road as before.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Taxis</strong> from anwhere in the centre of town should cost
            less than Â£5.

          <h2>Accomodation</h2>
          <p>
            If you are travelling from afar, or attending both days, then
            you will need to stay overnight on the Saturday. Oxford now
            boasts a Youth Hostel right next to the train station, and there
            are many lists of b&amp;bs available on-line. We can supply a
            hotel list -- send a mail to
            <a href="mailto:caption2004@caption.org?subject=Please%20send%20me%20your%20list%20of%20Hotels"><code>caption2004@caption.org</code></a> to
            request one.

          <h2>Bar and garden</h2>
          <p>
            One of CAPTION&rsquo;s unique advantages has been its cheap
            bar and sunny garden -- perfect for hob-nobbing with your
            comics-minded friends, whether you prefer slowly crisping in the sunshine or
            skulking in the shadows. Wolfson College also boasts a bar
            open for the event, has its own gardens, and is situated
            on the banks of the River Cherwell besides!
