          <p>
            In a change from previous years,
            CAPTION will be held in
            <strong>Wolfson College, Oxford</strong>,
            a large graduate college in North Oxford, beside the River

          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p>
            Join us at CAPTION for a weekend of comix-related workshops,
            panels, exhibitions, and other amusements.  Relax in the bar, in
            the big garden, or even by the side of the River Cherwell.  Buy
            comics from our very select collection of stallholders.  Leave
            your your own comics on the CAPTION table and we will sell them
            for you, leaving you free to join in the fun.

          <h2>CAPTION is History</h2>
          <p>
            This year the theme is <dfn>history</dfn>, touching on both the
            history <em>of</em> comics and the depiction of history <em>in</em>
            comics -- including autobiography (personal history).
          </p>
          <p>
            Our <a href="guests.html">special guests</a> Al Davison and Pat
            Mills can talk about the recent history of British comics
            from very different perspectives. We also have an
            <a href="talks.html">talks and panels</a> relating early sequential graphics to
            the comics of the present day.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            In true academic fashion we are introducing <dfn>lightning
            talks</dfn> -- where we ask people to talk for fifteen minutes
            on something they know a lot about, be it tricks for
            drawing bicycles or tips for promoting comix in shops.

          <h2>Selling your comics</h2>
          <p>
            If you want to sell your own zines at a con that usually
            means paying for a table and being trapped behind it, unable to join in the
            talks and workshops. Not so at CAPTION. We will sell your
            comics from the <dfn>CAPTION table</dfn> sale-or-return,
            charging just 10 per cent. of the money raised.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Buying comics</h2>
          <p>
            We feature a select group of top-quality stalls.
            <dfn>Smallzone</dfn>
            is a distributor for
            for small press and minicomics.
            <dfn>Capricorn Comics</dfn>
            distills
            weird and wonderful comics your local shop is too timid to
            stock, anything from classic undergrounds to crazy old issues of
            <cite>Lois Lane</cite>.
            And there is the aforementioned CAPTION table selling attendees&rsquo; works.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Bar and garden</h2>
          <p>
            One of CAPTION&rsquo;s unique advantages has been its cheap
            bar and sunny garden -- perfect for hob-nobbing with your
            comics-minded friends, whether you prefer slowly crisping in the sunshine or
            skulking in the shadows. Wolfson College also boasts a bar
            open for the event, has its own gardens, and is situated
            on the banks of the River Cherwell besides!
