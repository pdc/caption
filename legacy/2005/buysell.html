      <h2>Filthy lucre</h2>
      <p>
        A lot of people attending Caption have produced their own
        minicomics.  Perhaps you're one of them.
      </p>
      <h3>Selling your comics</h3>
      <p>
        We run a special stall called the Caption Table. You can bring
        comics you've made when you register and a Caption gofer will sell
        them on your behalf while you enjoy the con. At the end of the day you collect the unsold
        comics and the money raised, less a 10% cut.
      </p>
      <h3>Comix for sale</h3>
      <p>
        We feature a select group of top-quality stalls.
        <strong>Smallzone</strong>  is
        a distributor for for small press and minicomics.
        The <a href="http://www.smallzone.co.uk/">Smallzone web site</a> has reviews
        of small-press comics and info about how to get Smallzone to hand
        your distribution and even printing.
      </p>

        <strong>Capricorn Comics</strong>
        distills weird and wonderful comics your local shop is too timid to
        stock, anything from classic undergrounds to  old issues of
        <cite>Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen</cite>.
        And there is the aforementioned Caption Table selling
        attendees√ï works.

      <p>
        The biggest difference between Caption and other comics gatherings
        is that we don't expect you to sit behind a table if you have something to sell.
        We tried it once, and discovered it didn't really fit in with our
        DIY vibe -- if almost everyone is trapped behind their table then
        hardly anyone's going to be free to chat in the bar or splash ink
        about in a workshop!
