      <h2>Send us your art!</h2>
      <p>
        This year's mail-art exhibition will be remembering
        <a href="andy.html">Andy Roberts</a>
      </p>
      <h3>Exhibition</h3>
      <p>
        You can send any contributions to the new Caption address - CAPTION
        2005, 149 Campbell Rd, Oxford, OX4 3NX.  If you're not able to come to
        the con yourself but would like to contribute something to this
        exhibition, please include an SAE so we can return it to you.  If you've
        got something you would like included that you don't want to trust to
        the Royal Mail, bring it on the day (or entrust it to a friend to bring)
        - please let us know so that we can have display space ready.
      </p>
      <h3>Auction</h3>
      <p>
        Obviously we won't be auctioning off these pieces unless you
        specifically ask us to do so.  We will still be holding a separate
        auction of artwork and any contributions for that will also be very
        gratefully received.  The proceeds this year will be split between the
        <a href="http://www.abortionrights.org.uk/">Abortion Rights</a> campaign, a charity
        Andy campaigned for over many years, and the ICU at the Royal London
        Hospital who looked after Andy after the accident; you can state your
        preference (if you have one) when you pay for your winning bid.
      </p>
      <h3>Zine</h3>
      <p>
        There are also plans to produce a zine along the same theme in the
        relatively near future.  If you're happy for us to include the piece you
        lend us in the zine, please just pop a note to that effect in when you
        send it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of you may not have heard that Caption lost a very great friend
        this year.  Andy Roberts was a veteran of Caption from the very early
        days; he was a great supporter and friend to the convention and to the
        committee. He died last month after a traffic accident.
      </p>
      <p>
        We very much want to remember Andy at this year's Caption, and the
        most appropriate way to do that seemed to be to use the exhibition to
        showcase the impact Andy had on people throughout the scene and beyond.
        We're asking you to lend us artwork by Andy, featuring Andy, or
        inspired by Andy to make an exhibition celebrating his life.  If there's
        a story attached, feel free to write it up and include it, or if you
        prefer you can just let the piece speak for itself.
