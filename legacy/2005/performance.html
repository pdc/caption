      <h3>This year</h3>
      <p>
        New costumes made <em>by you the audience</em>
        of tinfoil, fun-fur and bananas. If we're lucky, Andy
        may do the banana dance.
      </p>
      <p>
        In tribute to Caption's friend and mine, Andy Roberts, a special
        puppet fight to the melodious tones of a Linus single; have hankies
        on standby, and wallets; the single will be in the charity auction!
      </p>
      <p>
        Your chance to hit the performers! Bring and bash with your
        favourite implement, be it rubber chickens, foam fish or smacky
        sausages. Please bear in mind that we need to return the performers
        in one, reasonably undented piece.

        Cardboard artshop. Make monkeys and robots alongside the experts,
        plus any other prop you feel they might be lacking.

        Those who have been before may wish to know that Caption 2005,
        Bargain Basement Caption, will feature the triumphant return of the
        Kochalka Puppet Theatre!
      </p>
      <p>
        And those who have never witnessed the comedy miracle of two grown men
        slugging each other with giant cardboard monkeys and robots, gasp in
        delight and quickly <a href="form.html">purchase a Caption membership</a> for this is an
        opportunity to see something never to be repeated and not to be missed!
