      <h1>Caption 2006 news</h1>
      <p class="dateline">20 January 2006</p>
      <p>
        The new licencing laws have claimed another victim: Captionâ€™s planned
        venue have just told us that under the new r&eacute;gime the bar needs a
        Temporary Event Notices for conventions like ours, and they need to keep
        their stock of Notices for their own events.
      </p>
      <p>
        With no bar, there obviously is no
        way to run Caption the way we want to.  We have started looking for
        other venues, and as we make progress we will be reporting it here or in
        the
        <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/caption/">Caption community on LiveJournal</a>
        and the
        <a href="http://caption.org/mailman/listinfo/caption-announce">Caption mailing list</a>.
