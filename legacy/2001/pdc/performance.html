    <h1>Damian's photos from Caption 2001</h1>
    <p>
      <span class="logo">Caption</span>,
      Oxford's annual small-press comics convention, was held in the
      Oxford Union Society, Oxford, England on the
      18th and 19th of August 2001.

      The James Kochalka Puppet Theatre are a couple of guys from Bristol,
      Andy Richmond and Richard Starzeki, who do crazy things with James
      Kochalka songs.
      Before the James Kochalka Puppet Theatre can perform, they have to
      build their giant cardboard puppets.

      At CAPTION they invited random
      artists from the bar to help them out.
      They had a list of how many puppets they would need -- so many robots,
      so many monkeys, a Kurt, a Courtney, ...   the venue was the dining room
      of the Oxford Union Society, so these  white cardboard slabs were being
      drawn on in very posh surroundings.

      painted, they have to be cut out and organized in to piles.  Cutting
      them out turns out to be quite a chore, since cardboard is tough and our
      cutting implements were small.
      
      <a href="t212.mvc-108sr.jpg" title="Monkeys!"><img src="t212.mvc-108sr-thumb.jpg" class="flicker" id="t212.mvc-108sr" align="right" width="100" height="75" /></a> The biggest piles are naturally the monkeys and the robots.
      
      <a href="t216.mvc-112sr.jpg" title="Robots!"><img src="t216.mvc-112sr-thumb.jpg" class="flicker" id="t216.mvc-112sr" align="left" width="100" height="75" /></a>  The Monkey Versus Robot dance als needs
      scientists, tanks, children, and a whole lot of other characters.

      Alas! We can't show you the performance itself here because (a) the camera
      I was using
      cannot work  in such low light levels, and (b) it is much more fun to
      watch when you aren't trying to take photos.   And those who have never
      witnessed the comedy miracle of two grown men slugging each other with
      giant cardboard monkeys and robots, well, you had to be there.
      
      <a href="t401.mvc-116sr.jpg" title="The tattered remains of the puppets are scattered
      around the 'stage'"><img src="t401.mvc-116sr-thumb.jpg" class="flicker" id="t401.mvc-116sr" align="right" width="100" height="75" /></a> What we can show you is the aftermath, with
      tattered puppets scattered about the stage after their violent
      reckoning with destiny.  Afterwards the audience snuck up to make off
      with any of the robots that still looked intact enough.
