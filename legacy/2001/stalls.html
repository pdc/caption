    <h1>Stalls at Caption 2001</h1>
    <p>
      <span class="logo">Caption</span>,
      Oxford's annual small-press comics convention, was held in the
      Oxford Union Society, Oxford, England on the
      18th and 19th of August 2001.
    </p>
    <p>
      As in previous years, we will have a select few stalls selling
      small-press comics and zines:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><em>Capricorn Comics</em></dt>
      <dd>
        Howard Stangroom's selection of the weird and wacky -- dotty
        old comics like <cite>Lois Lane</cite> and <cite>Superboy</cite>,
        old romance comics (especially appropriate for Caption 2001), and
        modern American comics that are too quirky for your local comics
        shop.  Howard co-runs a London shop 30th Century Comics (18 Lower
        Richmond Road, Putney, London, SW15 1JP.  Mail <a href="mailto:AmazonBoy@Bigfoot.com"><em>AmazonBoy@Bigfoot.com</em></a> Phone 020
        8788&nbsp;2052).
      </dd>
      <dt><em>Comics Creators' Guild</em></dt>
      <dd>
        The CCG is the professional organization for all British
        comics creators -- writers and artists, professional and
        amateur. They publish monographs on getting started in the comics
        biz, and hold meetings in London on the last Thursday of each
        month. Because of closure of the British Cartoon Centre, from July
        2001 these have been moved to the White Swan pub, 20 Farrington
        Road, London EC4.  W!n Wiacek runs the CCG stall to raise money
        for the Comic Book Legal Defence Fund.

        Pete Ashton's free-for-all discussionzine
        <cite>Viscious</cite> and review sheet <cite>TRS</cite> turned in
        to a small-press distro based in Birmingham.  Now he has moved to
        London and BugPowder has morphed in to a <a href="http://www.bugpowder.com/">weblog</a> about small-press and
        alternative comics.  Andy Luke (Belfast) has taken on
        zine-reviewing duties with <cite>TRS2</cite>, hosted on the BugPowder
        site.
