    <h1>Workshops</h1>
    <p>
      <span class="logo">Caption</span>,
      Oxford's annual small-press comics convention, was held in the
      Oxford Union Society, Oxford, England on the
      18th and 19th of August 2001.

    <h2>Woodrow Phoenix's League of Lonely Hearts</h2>
    <p>
      Woodrow Phoenix will be running an interactive panel at Caption
      2001 with superheros and romance as its inevitable theme.  Audience
      participation will be required!  Apparently this workshop format works
      well with 8-year-olds, so it should suit the CAPTION audience down to
      the ground...

    <h2>Jeremy Dennis's Romance Comics Race</h2>
    <p>
      Jeremy's crazy plan is to thrash out a plot for a romance comic and
      then race three teams against each other to produce a finished story
      -- pen and paper versus a Polaroid camera versus a digital camera and
      borrowed laptop.  With the romantic city of Oxford as a backdrop, how
      can we lose?

      is an amateur cartoonist living in
      Oxford -- as well as being one of the founding comittee members for
      CAPTION itself...
