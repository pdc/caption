    <p>
      Any donations for the charity auction will be gladly received;
      please get in touch.  All auction proceeds go to the Cartoon Art
      Trust.  We'd also love appropriate art for the programme, and
      effusions of a romantic nature suitable for hanging from the ceiling
      for our 'Tunnel Of Love' exhibition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please spread the word!  Caption's success is down to the
      people who come along, so let us know if you could use multiple flyers
      or put up a poster, or you know of somewhere we should be advertising.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'd also love to hear from you if you would like to be on a
      panel (tentative themes are 'Traditional',
      'Modern' and 'Weird' romance) or know someone who
      might; if you have an idea for a discussion, workshop or guest; or if
      you'd like to get involved in any other way.
    </p>
