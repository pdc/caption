      <dd>
        When, in disgrace with fortune and men&rsquo;s eyes, <br />
        I all alone beweep my outcast state <br />
        And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries <br />
        And look upon myself and curse my fate, <br />
        Wishing me like to one more rich in hope, <br />
        Featur&rsquo;d like him, like him with friends possess&rsquo;d, <br />
        Desiring this man&rsquo;s art and that man&rsquo;s scope, <br />
        With what I most enjoy contented least; <br />
        <br />
        Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising, <br />
        Haply I think on thee, and then my state, <br />
        Like to the lark at break of day arising <br />
        From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven&rsquo;s gate; <br />
        For thy sweet love rememb&rsquo;red such wealth brings <br />
        That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
