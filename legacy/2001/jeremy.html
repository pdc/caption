      <span class="logo">Caption</span>,
      Oxford's annual small-press comics convention, was held in the
      Oxford Union Society, Oxford, England on the
      18th and 19th of August 2001.

    <h1>The giant-sized special romance workshop race*</h1>
    
    
    
    <p>*or whatever it was that I called it.</p>
    
    <p>Ah, love in the air. A room full of people eager to get seriously
    romantic. Three lampshades, three wigs, ten plastic beer glasses. A
    romance comic in four hours? No problem!</p>
    
    <p>The principle is not unlike that head-body-legs game you played as
    a kid. You take each stage of a romance comic and draw something into
    each stage. Stage? Well, perhaps <i>storeme</i> is a better term. No?
    Well, you have a story, right, and it's made of a serious of
    separately identifiable moments; plot twists, significant scenes,
    dramatic moments, whatever. You break down you story, you pull out
    these moments, and bingo! You have the recipe for storytelling. Well,
    actually, you don't. It's just a system for looking at
    storytelling. For reference, it's called structuralism, and as a way
    of understanding the basic nature of writing, it sucks. However, as a
    basis for cartooning workshops, it rocks.</p>
    
    <p>So, previous to the workshop, I'd pulled the essential romance
    comic into nine stages. I added a tenth, for fun. I called on the
    spirit of Clive Anderson and took suggestions from the floor for each
    stage, explaining their significance and relevance to the basic
    principles of romance as I went along. Cartoonists are so
    romantic. Who else would suggest being set against each other in a
    bare-knuckle boxing match as the ideal situation in which love might
    blossom, or throwing rocks at them from behind a hedge as the perfect
    method for attracting your beloved's attention? How would you take
    your mind off being crossed in love? Plan world domination, of course;
    and handling rejection is no problem when you're ready to kill and
    pickle in the name of love.</p>
    
    <p>And then I split them into three random groups, divided up the wigs
    and lampshades, and drew from the suggestions provided earlier a
    ten-stage romance for each to turn into a comic. One group was
    provided with Lindsay-and-her-digital-camera and
    Niall-and-his-laptop. One group got a heap of sticky labels, a polariod
    Joycam, and three packs of film. The third group got the amazing Mr
    Andy Roberts, a heap of A3 paper, pens and pencils.</p>
    
    <p>All together now, on your marks, get set, and FALL IN LOVE!</p>
    <p>Here's what they did, in just a few hours, with only ten
    script-fragments to rest their stories on. [The strips will load into
