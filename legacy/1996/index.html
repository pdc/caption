            By 1996, even Jeremy was employed. We just didn't have the time or
            the energy left over any more to bust a gut trying to get a
            convention together. On the other hand, as Adrian pointed out, we
            didn't have to. The infrastructure was all in place, we had copies
            of all the right forms, there were plenty of people who wanted to
            come already. Could we do a slacker convention? We could. People
            continued to attend in proxy, this time as cardboard dollies of
            themselves (which sold very well at the auction!), the National
            Theatre of Earth Prime did a well-received re-run of
            <cite>Robin Lives with Bruce and Alfred</cite> and, finding ourselves short of time to laze
            around in the sun in we extended the convention to
            Sunday. Gorgeous.
