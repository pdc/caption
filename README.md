# Web site code for caption.org

CAPTION is an annual small-press comics convention held in Oxford, England. This is the code for the new CAPTION web site for 2012.

This is the third version of [caption.org][] â€“ the first two were a completely static site and one based on the [Drupal  content-management system][1]. This year I am doing it over using [Django][3].

## Plan

* Complete the brochure for CAPTION 2012.

* Deploy to <http://caption.org/>.

* Create an app for recycling the Drupal content (or otherwise convert the
old site to work with the new one).

* Link in the archives of old CAPTIONs so that history is properly preserved.

## Status

I have begun work on the structure of the 2012 brochure.
