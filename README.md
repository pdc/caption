# Web site code for caption.org

CAPTION is an annual small-press comics convention held in Oxford, England. This is the code for the new CAPTION web site for 2012.

This is the third version of [caption.org][] â€“ the first two were a completely static site and one based on the [Drupal  content-management system][1].
